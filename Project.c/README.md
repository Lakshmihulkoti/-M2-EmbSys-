# Prepaid Energy Meter using Arduino and GSM
Description :
                    In this project we are building a automated system by using Arduino and GSM module. we can recharge the electricity balance through this system, just by sending a SMS. It can also disconnect the home power supply connection, if there is low or zero balance in the system. And this system will reads the energy meter readings and automatically send some updates to user’s mobile phone like low balance alert, cut off alert, resume alert and recharge alert.
                   
# SWOT ANALYSIS :
 Strenghth:
 * Using this project we can reduce the readings from the energy meter which is cost effective solution
 * It is user friendly and we can enhance this project ,in which an electricity department can send meaasge to the customer about billing information.
 * it would reduce human efforts.
 * it provides better customer service.
 * Weakness : user will be responsibile for disconnections.
 * Opportunities:Prepaid Energy meter is a multipurpose project which can integrate all the functions like billing and automatic message responce to user.
 * Threats : user will be responsibile for disconnections.

The word prepaid means 
“pay before use” one of the advantageous feature of this concept prepaid energy meter is used to prepaid the 
ongoing supply of electricity to homes, offices etc

* Energy or electrical metre is a device that measures the amount of electrical energy consumed by a residence business or any electrical covid device .
* Electrical meteres are typically calibrated in billing units the most common one being the kilowatt hour.
* 
## GSM Modern :
* GSM modern is a specialised type of modem which accepts sim card ,and operates over subscription to a mobile operator ,just like a mobile phone.
* From the mobile operator prospective, a GSM modem looks like just mobile phone .
* When GSM modem is connected to computer, this allows a computer to use the GSM modem to communicate over the mobile network.
*  While these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile network connectivity many of them can also be used for sending and receiving SMS and MMS messages

## LCD :

 * Most common LCDs connected to the ardiuno are 16*2 display. 
 * which displays the amount of power consumed.

## Relay :
* A release is an electrically operated switch.
*  Many relays use an electromagnet to mechanically operated switch but other operating principles are used to such a solid state relays delays.
* Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by low-power signal (with complete technique electrical isolation between control and controlled circuits). or where several circuit must be controlled by one signal
 
AUXILARY COMPONENTS :
* Led lights are used to know the circuit status,means power in the circuit is present or not.
* crystal oscillator is used to generate the proper voltage to relays in arduino.
