## Components Required :
1) Arduino uno
2) 16x2 LCD Display
3) MQ2 Gas sensor
4) 10k potentioometer
5) ADC
6) Buzzer
7) 5v charge

## Arduino uno:

*	It  controls the whole process of this system like reading LPG Gas sensor module output, sending message to LCD and activating buzzer 
*	We can set sensitivity of this sensor module by inbuilt potentiometer placed on it.

## LCD :

* The Term LCD stand ,for liquid crystal display and Most common LCDs connected to the ardiuno are 16*2 display
*	It is necessary requirement to put a display about system monitoring and controlling performance, which displays the various messages such as leakage of gas detection


## LPG Gas Sensor :

*	A GAS SENSOR is an electronic device which Detects dangerous gas leaks in the industrial areas.
*	Good sensitivity to Combustible gas in wide range. 
*	High sensitivity to Propane, Butane and LPG.
*	Long life and low cost.

## BUZZER :

*	A buzzer or beeper is a audio signaling device, usually electronic, typically used in automobiles, household appliances such as a microwave oven, or game shows .
*	A buzzer is turned on after LPG gas leakage so it acts as a gas leakage alarm
