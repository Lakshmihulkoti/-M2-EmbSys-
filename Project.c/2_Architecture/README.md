•	It  controls the whole process of this system like reading LPG Gas sensor module output, sending message to LCD and activating buzzer 
•	We can set sensitivity of this sensor module by inbuilt potentiometer placed on it.

* The Term LCD stand ,for liquid crystal display and Most common LCDs connected to the ardiuno are 16*2 display

*	It is necessary requirement to put a display about system monitoring and controlling performance, which displays the various messages such as leakage of gas detection


## LPG Gas Sensor :

•	A GAS SENSOR is an electronic device which Detects dangerous gas leaks in the industrial areas.
•	Good sensitivity to Combustible gas in wide range. 
•	High sensitivity to Propane, Butane and LPG.
•	Long life and low cost.

## BUZZER :

•	A buzzer or beeper is a audio signaling device, usually electronic, typically used in automobiles, household appliances such as a microwave oven, or game shows .
•	A buzzer is turned on after LPG gas leakage so it acts as a gas leakage alarm

Applications
•	It is used in gas industries
•	It is used in mining if coal. And other materials.
•	It is used in municipal gas distribution
•	It is used in nuclear power station's
