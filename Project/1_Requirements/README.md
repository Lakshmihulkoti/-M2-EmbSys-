## Abstract:
 This project has a gas leakage detector implemented by using an LPG Gas sensor.LPG is an essential need of every household,To alert on LPG leakage and prevent any mishappening there are various products to detect the leakage. Here we have developed an Arduino based LPG gas detector alarm. If gas leakage occurs, this system detects it and makes an alert by buzing the buzzer attached with the circuit A Gas sensor is used to detect dangerous gas leaks in the kitchen or near the gas heater. Ideal to detect dangerous gas leaks in the kitchen. The sensor can also sense LPG and Coal Gas as well as Ideal sensor for use to detect the presence of a dangerous LPG leak in your car or in a service station, storage tank environment. 
 
 ## Identifying features :
 * This module contains a MQ3 sensor which actually detects LPG gas.
 * It gives a HIGH output when LPG gas  is sensed. 
 * A potentiometer is also used for controlling sensitivity of gas sensing.
 * Arduino controls the whole process of this system like reading LPG Gas sensor module output, sending message to LCD and activating buzzer.

 ## Strength:
* Detection and Prevention of any sort of gas leakage.
* No environmental effect or no effect of physical conditions.
* A Gas sensor is used to detect dangerous gas leaks in the kitchen or near the gas heater.
* The sensor has excellent sensitivity combined with a quick response time..
* This system provides quick response rate and diffusion if the critical situation can be made faster than the manual mathods

## Weakness: 
* It work only when at 5v power supply.
* It's sensitivity depends on Humidity and temperature.
* It may lead to fetal disaster and may cause human and material loss.

## Opportunities :
 * These sensors usually employ an audible alarm to alert people when a dangerous gas has been detected
 * The propsed system will help in giving better protection to life and propety.
 * They may be used in firefighting.
  
 ## Threats :
 * No prevention of fires possible with kit
 * That can, in turn, lead to severe headaches, fatigue, decreased vision, short breaths, and even loss of consciousness.
