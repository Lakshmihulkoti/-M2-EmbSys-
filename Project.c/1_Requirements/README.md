# Description :
           In this project we are building a automated system by using Arduino and GSM module. we can recharge the electricity balance through this system,just by sending a SMS. It can also disconnect the home power supply connection, if there is low or zero balance in the system. And this system will reads the energy meter readings and automatically send some updates to user’s mobile phone like low balance alert, cut off alert, resume alert and recharge alert. and The word prepaid means"pay before use” one of the advantageous feature of this concept prepaid energy meter is used to prepaid the ongoing supply of electricity to homes, offices etc.

 # Abstract :
 PRE-PAID ENERGY METER based technology which is
found by Thomas Edison. PRE-PAID ENERGY METER
refers to the ease of human life. This is nothing but the
user can select the amount of electricity the user wants to
consume and according to that user can pay the amount
earlier and consume electricity according to it.
This technology can overcome current technology and
process of electricity bill payment. It can be implemented
on small scale i.e., in-home, and on a large scale i.e., big
industries as well. The pre-paid energy meter can stand on
measures like safety, accuracy, environment friendly, etc. 


                   
# SWOT ANALYSIS :

![swot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98826329/156692082-ebe1ad15-f109-49b5-af80-bb01a1389404.jpg)

 ## Strength:
 * Using this project we can reduce the readings from the energy meter which is cost effective solution
 * It is user friendly and we can enhance this project ,in which an electricity department can send meaasge to the customer about billing information.
 * it would reduce human efforts.
 * it provides better customer service.
 ##   Weakness: 
  * User will be responsibile for disconnections of the home power supply.
 ## Opportunities :
  * Prepaid Energy meter is a multipurpose project which can integrate all the functions like billing and automatic message responce to user.
 ## Threats :
  * User will be responsibile for disconnections of the home power supply.
 
 # 4 W'S and 1'H 
## WHO :
* Everyone can use the prepaid energy meter who want to have benefit of this sysyem.
 ## WHAT : 
* Prepaid meters allow consumers to track their electricity usage in real time. 
* This can incentivise customers to save money by reducing use of power-guzzling appliances if they feel that their power usage is spiralling out of their household budget.
## WHEN :
* when we need to recharge our system, we can recharge it simply by sending a SMS to the system, through our Cellphone.
## WHERE :
* User can  access this application using any embedded C compiler.

## HOW : 
* These meters are opertaes based on the amount available at meters. 

# Detail Requirements :

## High level Requirements:
 |    HLR                        |              Description                  |  
 |-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
 |  HLR1                         | It shall disconnect the home power supply connection.  |
 | HLR2                          | system shall reads the energy meter readings and  automatically send some updates to user’s mobile phone.|
 | HLR3                          | user shall be responsibile for disconnections of the home power supply.|
 | HLR4                           | These meters are operates based on the amount available at meters.|
 
## Low level Requirements:
|    LLR       |              Description                  |
|-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| LLR1 | it automatically send some updates to user’s mobile phone like low balance alert, cut off alert, resume alert and recharge alert. |
| LLR2 | say If available balance is greater then 15 rupes then, ARDUINO turn on the electricity of home or office by using relay.|
| LLR3 | If balance is less then 15 rupes, ARDUINO Sends SMS to the user phone regarding low balance alaret & requesting to recharge soon.  |
| LLR4 | If balance is low or zero ,then ARDUINO shall turn off and power cutoff due to low balance.|
