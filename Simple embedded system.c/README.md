The function of traffic lights is to provide sophisticated control and coordination to ensure that traffic moves as smoothly and safety as possible.
Nowdays,controlling the traffic becomes major issue because of rapid increase in automobiles and also because of large time delays between traffic lights.so,inorder to rectify this problem.we will go for large time delays between traffic lights system.

* this system uses a LED light as an indicator and  IR sensors for receiving the signal from traffic.
* A microcontroller for auto change signalaftera specifictime interval.
* The LEDs are automatically on and off by making the corresponding port pin of the microcontroller high.

working of traffic signal:
* In this system,we will use IR Sensors to measure
