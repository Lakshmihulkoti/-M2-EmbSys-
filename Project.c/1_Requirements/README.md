## Abstract:
 This project has a gas leakage detector implemented by using an LPG Gas sensor.LPG is an essential need of every household,To alert on LPG leakage and prevent any mishappening there are various products to detect the leakage. Here we have developed an Arduino based LPG gas detector alarm. If gas leakage occurs, this system detects it and makes an alert by buzing the buzzer attached with the circuit A Gas sensor is used to detect dangerous gas leaks in the kitchen or near the gas heater. Ideal to detect dangerous gas leaks in the kitchen. The sensor can also sense LPG and Coal Gas as well as Ideal sensor for use to detect the presence of a dangerous LPG leak in your car or in a service station, storage tank environment. 
 
 ## Identifying features :
 * This module contains a MQ3 sensor which actually detects LPG gas.
 * It gives a HIGH output when LPG gas  is sensed. 
 * A potentiometer is also used for controlling sensitivity of gas sensing.
 * Arduino controls the whole process of this system like reading LPG Gas sensor module output, sending message to LCD and activating buzzer.  

 
 
                 
# SWOT ANALYSIS :

 ## Strength:
 
* A Gas sensor is used to detect dangerous gas leaks in the kitchen or near the gas heater.
* The sensor has excellent sensitivity combined with a quick response time..
* This system provides quick response rate and diffusion if the critical situation can be made faster than the manual mathods

## Weakness:
* It may lead to fetal disaster and may cause human and material loss.

## Opportunities :
 * These sensors usually employ an audible alarm to alert people when a dangerous gas has been detected
 * The propsed system will help in giving better protection to life and propety.
  
 ## Threats :
 * No prevention of fires possible with kit

 |-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
 |  HLR1                         | User shall get notify when LPG Gas is sensed  |
 | HLR2                          | User shall not get notify when no LPG Gas is sensed |
 | HLR3                          | user shall get better protection to life and property | 

 
## Low level Requirements:
|    LLR       |              Description                  |
|-------------------------------|:------------------------------------------|
| LLR1 | This system triggers LED and buzzer to alert people when LPG leakage is detected LED get turn on when .|
| LLR2 | LPG leakage detection is essential to prevent accidents and to save human lives.  |
| LLR3 | It shall alert through Buzzer when system detects LPG GAS |
